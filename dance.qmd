title: "Highland Dance"
---

I started highland dancing in 2017 and have been at it ever since. Growing up I was a ballet dancer for 15 years and then took a long break in college and grad school. When my daughter was 4 she asked me to take a dance class with her and the rest was history! Here are a few photos of me in my kilt, aboyne, Irish jig dress, and sailor outfit for doing the Sailor's Hornpipe dance.
